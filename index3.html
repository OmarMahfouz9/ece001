       <h1>What Can AI Do?</h1>
       <p>What can AI be used for? One of the broad goals of artificial intelligence is autonomous machine intelligence, with machine learning being one of the specific scientific methods used in constructing AI.Through autonomous machine intelligence, computers, mechanisms, and systems powered by AI could take much of the burden of decision-making, repetitive action, and instantaneous response away from humans, leading to greater efficiencies and performance improvements at all levels. This is one of the more optimistic visions of how artificial intelligence will change the future. Weâ€™re still a way off from achieving this level, and there are safety, ethical, and practical considerations to deal with before it becomes a workable reality.</p>
       <p>AI capabilities that are being exploited, such as the ability to sift through vast amounts of data and make logical connections between past actions and different criteria. You may have found your way to this web page through a search engine, for example. That process was powered by artificial intelligence.</p>
       <h4>Other examples of artificial intelligence at work include:</h4>
       <ul>
            <li>Personalization of news feeds and automatic recognition of similar features in images on social media.</li>
            <li>Voice-to-text conversion on smartphones and the use of artificial neural networks to power voice search.</li>
            <li>Product searching and recommendations on eCommerce platforms.</li>
            <li>Email and message system spam filtering, which uses algorithms to learn from a variety of signals, such as pre-set rules, the words in the message, and message metadata (information about the message, such as time and location stamps).</li>
            <li>Smart categorization of email, like the way that Gmail separates messages into Primary, Promotional, or Social inboxes.</li>
            <li>Grammar and spelling checkers in word processing and educational application platforms.</li>
            <li>Automated decision making for online credit applications.</li>
            <li>Fraud detection and prevention for financial systems.</li>

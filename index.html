        <h1>Artificial intelligence</h1>
        <h3>What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?</h3>
            <P>Artificial intelligence (AI) is a wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with building smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI is an interdisciplinary science with multiple approaches, but advancements in machine learning and deep learning are creating a paradigm shift in virtually every sector of the tech industry</P>
        <h3>HOW DOES ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WORK?</h3>
            <P>Norvig and Russell go on to explore four different approaches that have historically defined the field of AI:</P>
            
                <li>Thinking humanly</Li>
                <li>Thinking rationally</Li>
                <li>Acting humanly </li>
                <li>Acting rationally</Li>
           
            <P>The first two ideas concern thought processes and reasoning, while the others deal with behavior. Norvig and Russell focus particularly on rational agents that act to achieve the best outcome, noting "all the skills needed for the Turing Test also allow an agent to act rationally." (Russel and Norvig 4).</P> 
            <P>"AI is a computer system able to perform tasks that ordinarily require human intelligence... Many of these artificial intelligence systems are powered by machine learning, some of them are powered by deep learning and some of them are powered by very boring things like rules."</P>
        <h3>HOW IS AI USED?</h3> 
            <P>Narrow AI: Sometimes referred to as "Weak AI," this kind of artificial intelligence operates within a limited context and is a simulation of human intelligence. Narrow AI is often focused on performing a single task extremely well and while these machines may seem intelligent, they are operating under far more constraints and limitations than even the most basic human intelligence. </P>
            <P>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): AGI, sometimes referred to as "Strong AI," is the kind of artificial intelligence we see in the movies, like the robots from Westworld or Data from Star Trek: The Next Generation. AGI is a machine with general intelligence and, much like a human being, it can apply that intelligence to solve any problem.</P>
